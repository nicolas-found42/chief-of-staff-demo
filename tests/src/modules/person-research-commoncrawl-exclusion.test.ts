/**
 * Common Crawl capture retrieval, or a recorded exclusion (issue #254).
 *
 * The eligibility record's `commoncrawl` route probes only the CDX index
 * catalogue (`collinfo.json`): the catalogue answering proves reachability and
 * says nothing about whether a capture's bytes can be retrieved, which is the
 * only thing that could contribute evidence to a Profile. The terms assessment
 * (ADR-0072) concludes the capture route is excluded — ToU §2(l) prohibits
 * collecting personal information for use separately from the Crawled Content,
 * and the ToU provides no citation exception — so these tests pin the
 * exclusion: index discovery stays distinct from capture retention in both the
 * code path and the source accounting, and no Common Crawl answer presents
 * itself as dated capture evidence.
