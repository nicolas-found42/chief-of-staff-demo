/**
 * Home's sentence and rail, unit-tested rather than driven through the browser.
 *
 * Two of the five states are unreachable end to end: `quiet` needs a connected
 * Google account, which the e2e workspace has no way to obtain, and `live` needs
 * a Run that stays non-terminal, which the mock provider never produces. The
 * sentence is a pure function of what the Shell observes precisely so those
 * states can be asserted somewhere.
