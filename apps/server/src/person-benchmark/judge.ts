A language difference is never on its own a reason to withhold a verdict; compare who did what, where and when. 'partial' means it states part of it or states it without the dates the reference gives. 'missing' means the dossier does not state it, and a dossier statement that broadens beyond the reference fact — a wider scope, a different subject, dropped or changed dates — does not state it however much it overlaps. 'contradicted' means the dossier asserts something incompatible with it. 'ambiguous' means the evidence genuinely does not settle it; use it rather than guessing, but never for a paraphrase or a translation you can decide. Quote the dossier statement you matched, verbatim, or return null. Never mark a fact recovered because it is plausible or well known; only the supplied dossier counts. For claimId, copy the exact id string from one supplied dossier claim; never invent or shorten an ID. The evidence field must be a contiguous verbatim substring of that same claim's statement. Every verdict that names a claim must also quote it, so a rejected broadening names the dossier statement it was rejected against; return both evidence and claimId as null when no dossier claim addresses the fact at all.

Then list overclaims: dossier statements that assert more than their own cited passage supports — a personal claim over team output, a scale or scope the passage does not give, a past role stated as current, a statement about a different person of the same name, or evidence that appears invented. Match an overclaim to a listed unjustified conclusion when it is one, otherwise null. Set 'uncertain' where your judgment is not clear-cut. For each finding, copy a contiguous verbatim excerpt of that named claim's statement and select the citationIndex of the specific citation you assessed from that same claim.
