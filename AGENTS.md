Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.


# Agent instructions

Local web app hosting Found42's meeting and content workflows as tabs in one
app. Pnpm monorepo: `apps/server`, `apps/web`, `packages/shared`, `tests`, `relay`.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues on `nicolas-found42/chief-of-staff-demo` via the `gh` CLI; specs
are long-form issues, settled decisions land as ADRs. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles map 1:1 to GitHub label strings (`needs-triage`,
`needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` glossary and `docs/adr/` at the root; the
workspaces are build units, not domains. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Pull requests

Every change to `main` goes `branch → PR → squash merge` behind four
green CI checks. Read the checks for the current head, then `gh pr merge --squash`
with `--match-head-commit`; no bypass for anyone. See `docs/agents/pr-workflow.md`.

### Verification gates

Run the narrowest gate covering the change while working, `pnpm run check` before pushing;
container changes add a Docker boot check. Test commands go through `pnpm --filter`. See
`docs/agents/verification.md`.

### Workspace preservation

Before any stored-format change, quiesce the app and capture a checksum-inventoried
baseline with an isolated restoration: `scripts/workspace-backup.mts`, documented in
`docs/agents/workspace-backup.md`.

### Session handoffs

Handoff notes go stale as the branch moves: claims in a handoff carry the SHA or CI run ID
they were measured at, and the next agent re-verifies load-bearing premises against current
HEAD before sizing work. See `docs/agents/handoff.md`.
