 * Professional and institutional records, read as evidence rather than as

 *
 * A federal provider registry or a trial registration proves an identifier
 * resolved. What a Profile can use is the record's own fields — who it names,
 * what dates it carries, and what publishing it public actually establishes —
 * kept apart from the generic JSON flattener that would otherwise carry the
 * whole body into retained text with no rights basis and no version.
 *
 * The attribution rule this ticket adds is stricter than participation: a
 * registry entry establishes that the named individual matched this record. It
 * does not establish that they are competent, credentialed, currently
 * available, or personally responsible for their organisation's output, so an
 * NPI record's "authorized official" of a hospital system, or a trial's
 * principal investigator of a multi-site study, is rendered with that limit
 * attached rather than as a demonstrated capability.
 *
 * Same-name records are held apart by the identity resolution that already
 * runs over every source (`PersonResearch.decideIdentity` in `research.ts`):
 * a record naming this person alongside no other corroborating signal is
 * attributed at reduced ("probable") confidence rather than merged into
 * confirmed fact, and a record naming this person alongside a conflicting
 * affiliation is rejected outright. That corroboration is read from
 * `namedIndividuals` below, each entry's own affiliation strings, never from
 * a trial's lead sponsor or responsible organization or an NPI's
 * organisation name: a record-level field is the record's, not the named
 * individual's, and cannot stand in for their own affiliation (review
 * finding on issue #250, PR #295). Nothing here repeats that resolution;
 * this module only renders what one matched record says.
