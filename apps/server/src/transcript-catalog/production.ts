 * ingestion service — consent, the processing ledger, and immutable record
 * registration — existed but was constructed nowhere outside tests and the
 * browser-suite seed. Transcript → Tasks was therefore still the only thing
 * reading the transcript folder, which is exactly the duplicate intake #142
 * retires. This is the replacement it is retired in favour of.
 *
 * The Catalog polls nothing on its own: a pass processes what the source
 * lists, and the caller decides when a pass runs. That keeps one Drive client,
 * one folder read, and one checkpoint in the Workspace.
