 * The deterministic half of the evaluation.

 * These checks answer questions that have a right answer: does the quoted
 * passage occur in the retained source version, is the source still attributed
 * to this dossier, does a supported claim actually carry a citation, does a
 * work reference a claim that exists, and did private Workspace evidence stay
 * out of the public projection.
 *
 * A semantic judge cannot overrule any of them. A model that finds a claim
 * "clearly true" has said nothing about whether the record supporting it is
 * intact, and a benchmark that let it say so would reward invented citations.
