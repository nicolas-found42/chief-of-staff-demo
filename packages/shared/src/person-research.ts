/**
 * The Person Research Failure contract (issue #228).
 *
 * Production research and the benchmark evaluator record the same records, so
 * a developer debugging a benchmark miss reads the pipeline's own account of
 * what happened rather than an evaluation-side imitation of it.
 *
 * Three separations are load-bearing and are enforced by the shape rather
 * than by convention:
 *
 * - **Stage** (where the work stopped) is not **code** (what was observed).
 *   A 403 during retrieval is `stage: "access"`, `code: "http-error"`; it is
 *   not evidence that the page needs a login.
 * - **Observed** facts are not **hypotheses**. `cause` says which one this
 *   record is, and an unclassified failure stays `"unknown"` rather than
 *   receiving an invented explanation.
 * - An **attempt** is one try; `attemptOf` links a retry or a fallback to the
 *   attempt it is recovering, so a summary that shows the last line can never
 *   erase how the pipeline got there.
