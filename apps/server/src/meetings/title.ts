 * What a transcript-owned Meeting is called (issue: Meeting Wizard naming).
 *
 * A Meeting created from a Transcript alone has no Calendar summary to take
 * its name from, so the name has to be recovered. Three sources, best first:
 *
 * 1. the transcript's own leading Markdown heading — the exporter writes the
 *    meeting's real name there, punctuation intact ("Found42 Stand-Up
 *    Meeting"), where the file name has already lost it to the separator;
 * 2. the file name, with the exporter's artifact words and Drive's copy
 *    prefix stripped (`meetingFileNameMeta`);
 * 3. a model pass over the two, for names neither rule can repair.
 *
 * The first two are deterministic and free; the model only ever sees names
 * the deterministic pass could not settle, and a failure falls back to it
 * rather than blocking the join.
