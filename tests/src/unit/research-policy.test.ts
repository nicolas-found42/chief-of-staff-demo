/**
 * The four policies one research operation runs under, asked directly.
 *
 * Each of these was a closure inside `PersonResearch.run`, so the only way to
 * ask what the budget does at its ceiling, or which leads selection defers, was
 * to drive a whole operation and infer the answer from its report (#231). The
 * completion conditions joined them for the same reason: whether an operation
 * has earned the word "completed" is a question with an answer, and reading it
 * off a conclusion the loop happened to reach is not asking it (#238).
