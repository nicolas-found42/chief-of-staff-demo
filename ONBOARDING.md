# Set up Chief of Staff

This guide takes you from nothing to a working app. It takes about 20 minutes. Most of that time
is Google's setup, which the app itself walks you through.

You do not need to know Docker, and you do not need to install Node or anything else. Docker
Desktop runs the whole app for you.

Work through the steps in order. Do not skip one.

---

## 1. Install Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop runs this app in a self-contained box, so nothing else on your machine has to
change.

1. Go to **https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/**
2. Download the version for your computer. On a Mac, pick **Apple Silicon** for an M1/M2/M3/M4
   Mac, or **Intel chip** for an older one. If you are not sure, click the Apple menu, then
   **About This Mac**, and read the **Chip** line.
3. Open the file you downloaded and install it.

## 2. Start Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop must be **running**, not only installed. This is the step people miss.

1. Open Docker Desktop from your Applications folder.
2. Accept the terms if it asks.
3. Wait. A whale icon appears in your menu bar and animates while Docker starts.
4. **Do not continue until the whale stops moving.** Until then, the next step fails with an
   error about a socket or a daemon.

## 3. Get the code

Open the **Terminal** app. Copy each line below, paste it, and press Return.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicolas-found42/chief-of-staff-demo.git
```

```bash
cd chief-of-staff-demo
```

Skip the first line if you already have the folder. Run the second line either way — every
command after this one must run inside that folder.

## 4. Start the app

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The first run takes a few minutes. It prints a lot of text. That is normal.

The `-d` puts the app in the background, so your Terminal comes back to you when it is ready.
When you see your prompt again, the app is running.

## 5. Open the app

Go to **http://localhost:4317** in your browser.

You see **Home**, and a yellow bar saying Google is not set up yet. That is correct for now — you
fix it in step 7. Home is the app's front door: it tells you where things stand and links to the
tabs. Transcripts go in on the **Transcript → Tasks** tab.

## 6. Choose an extraction provider

The app sends each transcript to an AI provider to pull out the action items. You need an API key
from one provider.

1. Click **Settings**.
2. Under **Extraction provider**, choose your provider.
3. The page shows a link to that provider's key page. Open it, sign in, and create a key.
4. Paste the key into **Provider API key**.
5. Leave **Model** as it is.
6. Click **Save settings**.

Providers charge for use. Create the key on the account that pays for it.

## 7. Connect Google

The app creates Google Tasks and Gmail drafts, so Google must give it permission. Google requires
each person to register their own credentials for this. There is no shared credential to hand you.

On the same **Settings** page, find the **Google** card. It lists every step, in order, with the
exact values to copy and a link to each Google page. Follow the card, not this guide: it shows the
values for your own machine, and this guide cannot.

First, tell the card which kind of Google account you will use. This matters:

- **A work account** (`you@yourcompany.com`) can set the consent screen to **Internal**. That
  removes one step, removes the weekly sign-in, and removes the warning screen below. Choose this
  if you have one.
- **A personal account** (`@gmail.com`) cannot. Google greys Internal out.

Three things to expect:

- **Check the project name in the console's top bar after you create the project.** Google does
  not switch to a project it has just created. If the rest of the work happens in a different
  project, the first run fails much later with a permission error.
- **Google shows the client secret once.** Copy it, or use **Download JSON** and load that file
  into the card. You cannot look at the secret again.
- **On a personal account, Google warns that it has not verified the app.** This is expected: the
  app is yours and Google has not reviewed it. Click **Continue** — the small link at the
  bottom left. Do **not** click **Back to safety**, which is the large button. On a work account
  with Internal, this screen does not appear at all.

If a step fails, the steps stay on screen. Read the message, correct that step, and sign in again.

When it works, the card says **Connected** and shows your email address.

If you are unsure whether every step is done, click **Check my setup**. The app asks Google and
names the exact part that is missing.

## 8. Run a transcript

1. Click **Runs**.
2. Drag the file `tests/fixtures/transcripts/sample-transcript.md` from the project folder onto
   the upload area. You can also click the area and pick the file.
3. The run appears in the table. Click it to watch it work.

## 9. Check the result

Open Google and confirm all three:

1. **Google Tasks** has a list called **Meeting Followups** with **three** tasks. Each task has
   its owner in the notes, like `Owner: Priya`.
2. **Gmail Drafts** has **one** draft addressed to Acme procurement. It is a draft. The app
   cannot send mail.
3. Back in the app, the run says **done**.

If you see all three, you are set up.

## Signing in to Google again

If you used a **work account** and chose **Internal**, skip this section. Your sign-in does not
expire.

If you used a **personal account**, Google ends this kind of sign-in after about seven days.
**This is normal, and nothing is broken.**

The Google card in Settings shows when you last signed in. When Google asks:

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Click **Sign in with Google**.

That is the whole fix. You do not repeat the setup steps.

## Starting and stopping the app

Run these from the `chief-of-staff-demo` folder.

Stop the app:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Start it again later:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Leave out `--build` after the first time. You only need it again when the code changes.

The app does not start by itself when you turn your computer on. Start it when you want it.

## When something is wrong

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| An error about a socket, a daemon, or `docker` not found | Docker Desktop is not running. Go back to step 2 and wait for the whale to stop moving. |
| The browser cannot open http://localhost:4317 | The app is not running. Run `docker compose up -d`, wait a moment, and try again. |
| A run says **failed** at `extract` | The provider key or the model is wrong. Correct it in Settings, then click **Retry** on the run. |
| A run says **failed** at `outputs` | Google is not connected. Open Settings, fix the Google card, then click **Retry** on the run. The app does not charge you twice: it reuses the result it already has. |
| Google refuses the sign-in and names the redirect URI | The value you registered does not match. The Google card shows the exact string to use. Copy it with the Copy button rather than typing it. |
| **Access blocked … Error 403: access_denied** | The account you signed in with is not on the consent screen's **Test users** list. Add it under Audience → Test users, then sign in again with that same account. There is no way past this screen. |
| A run fails and the app names a project number | The APIs were enabled on a different project than the one you configured. Compare the number the app shows with the project in the console's top bar. |
| A run says **skipped** | The app decided the file is not a transcript. It creates nothing. This is correct behaviour, not a fault. |

Anything else: send the person who gave you this repo the run id and what the page says.
