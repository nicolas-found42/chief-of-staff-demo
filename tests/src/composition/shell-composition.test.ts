/**
 * The composition root, composed for real — the gap behind three defects.
 *
 * The Transcript Catalog (#125) passed a full suite while production
 * constructed it nowhere: every spec built the Catalog itself, so passing was
 * compatible with the app never touching it. #144 was the same shape one level
 * down — the runs directory and the V1 watchlist were created on the boot path
 * but not by the in-process cutover the gate performs, so a Workspace migrated
 * without a restart came up missing both. Neither was reachable from a test,
 * because `main.ts` was a top-level-await script that bound a port: importing it
 * was starting the server, and the only wiring a test could examine was its
 * source text.
 *
 * `composeShell` is that script as a function. It builds the whole graph and
 * registers every route without listening, so a Shell composes over a temporary
 * Workspace in about a tenth of a second and answers through `app.inject`. Every
 * assertion below is on what the composition did, not on what it looks like.
