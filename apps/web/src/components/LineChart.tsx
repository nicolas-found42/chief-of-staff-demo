/**
 * The sixth UI primitive (ADR-0015, amended): a single-series line chart, used
 * at two scales — a channel's total views over time, and one video's when its
 * row is expanded.
 *
 * Single-series on purpose. One line per video on a two-hundred-video channel is
 * a smear, and a selectable multi-series chart is exactly where a charting
 * library gets adopted — which is what ADR-0015 exists to resist. Inline SVG,
 * no dependency, no axes: the numbers are in the table beside it, and this says
 * one thing, which is the shape.
