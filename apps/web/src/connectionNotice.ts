 * predicate would be a second thing that can disagree with what is on screen.
 *
 * The wording names Tasks and Gmail but never a Module's pipeline. The string
 * this replaced — "runs will extract tasks but have nowhere to put them" —
 * described Transcript's stages, which is the Module leaking into a Shell
 * concern; Tasks and Gmail are Google surfaces, and the connection is the
 * Shell's only route to them.
