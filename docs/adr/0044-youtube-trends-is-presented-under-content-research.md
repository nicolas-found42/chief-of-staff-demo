# YouTube Trends is presented under Content Research

The consolidation spec places YouTube Trends' product surface at
`/content-research/trends` (spec § Content Research: "YouTube Trends is presented at
`/content-research/trends` and keeps an independent measurement Run and spreadsheet output")
and records "the legacy top-level YouTube route is not required by the new product journey".
We moved the surface and removed `/youtube`; we did **not** merge the Module into Content
Research's own Module (ADR-0039 keeps that one watching Named People, with its own Runs,
result shape, checkpoints and retry receipts, and this spec keeps Trends' independent
measurement Run and spreadsheet output).

## What changed

- **Presentation, not identity.** `ModuleDescriptor` gains `parent` — the id of the Module
  whose product surface presents this one. `youtube-trends` keeps its id, its
  `HostedModule` identity on the Shell (the Shell still holds a `HostedModule` and nothing
  more), and its own routes under `/api/youtube/*`. Only the address and the nav change:
  `path` becomes `/content-research/trends`, `parent` becomes `"content-research"`.
- **The tab bar renders live, top-level Modules.** A Module with a `parent` is announced on
  Home (its card links to the new path) and entered from its parent's page —
  `ContentResearchPage` and the Trends page both render the same `ContentResearchSubNav`
  (Resonance ↔ YouTube Trends), so the two routes read as one product with two sub-surfaces.
  This extends ADR-0014's membership rule: a planned Module leaves the tab bar because it
  holds no function; a presented-under Module leaves it because its function is promised by
  its parent's tab. Neither is announced by a second tab, and Home stays the surface where
  what exists is enumerated.
- **`/youtube` is gone, not deprecated.** The spec says the legacy route "is not required
  by the new product journey" — nothing else links to it, no tests assert it, and a
  deprecated route that 200s forever is exactly the second entrance to the same surface the
  spec's IA work removes. `/youtube` now answers with the Shell's own not-found page, which
  the accessibility suite already walks.

## What did not change

- The Module's Runs, `enumerate`/`fetch`/`publish` Stages, trend index, intake schedule,
  spreadsheet output, and retry receipts are untouched — the existing module-level and
  API-level suites still pass unchanged, and the new clean-output contract suite pins them.
- Settings keeps the spreadsheet setup card; the post-reset contract (clean new Sheets, no
  auto-restore of the old destination, writes only to the newly configured spreadsheet) is
  tested over the Module's own endpoints with a fake Sheets adapter that records every
  spreadsheet id it is ever asked to touch.

## Considered Options

- **A second tab at `/content-research/trends`.** Rejected: a top-level tab would present
  Trends as a sibling of Content Research rather than a part of its product, and the spec's
  product areas describe one Content Research surface.
- **Keep `/youtube` alongside the new route.** Rejected: the spec names it not required, so
  keeping it leaves two entrances where the spec wants one, and route-not-found tests
  already cover the Shell's behavior for unknown addresses.
- **Serve the Trends page inside ContentResearchPage's route.** Rejected: the two pages
  have unrelated state and the Shell's route-not-found, focus-on-navigation, and
  aria-current contracts are per-route; nesting the components would couple them for no
  behavior either side needs.

## Consequences

- The nav loses one tab; Home's tiles do not change in count, and the tile for YouTube
  Trends links to `/content-research/trends`.
- Any future Module presented under another Module's surface gets the same seam: one
  `parent` field, no new mechanism.
- The e2e suite walks `/content-research/trends` in place of `/youtube` (route list, 44px
  target-size scan, journey test) and asserts the tab-bar membership and Home link paths.
