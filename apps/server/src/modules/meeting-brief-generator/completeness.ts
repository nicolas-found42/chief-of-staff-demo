 * Meeting Brief completeness and retry policy (issue #137).

 * Every provider selected in an attendee's versioned bundle is required: a
 * Brief is never composed or delivered while a required provider outcome is
 * failed (spec #82, Decision 19). The Run records one versioned outcome per
 * selected provider — outcome, diagnostics and the reusable artifact — so a
 * sibling's success survives a failure and a retry reruns only the missing
 * work. Automatic retries use bounded backoff and stop 30 minutes before the
 * occurrence start; at cutoff the Run fails visibly and sends nothing.
 *
 * A provider leaves the required set only through an explicit policy action
 * recorded on the Run; nothing here relaxes a requirement by itself.
