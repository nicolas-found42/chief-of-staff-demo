/**
 * The destructive boundary of the consolidation cutover, as a read-only inventory
 * — issue://119, ADR-0043.
 *
 * The preview classifies every local persistence category the Workspace can hold
 * and reports nothing but category names and counts, so a person can see what a
 * reset would take and what it would keep without any stored value being shown.
 * The preview itself reads and never writes; the reset (issue://144) shares this
 * module and deletes, rewrites, and marks exactly what the preview classifies.
 * Neither ever calls a provider: the reset's validation reads the rewritten
 * files back and checks structure, never reachability.
 *
 * `config.json` and `relay.json` each hold authentication material and product
 * state in one file. They are parsed key by key against an explicit table rather
 * than preserved wholesale, and a key the table does not name fails the whole
 * preview closed: an unclassifiable key is exactly the ambiguity the reset must
 * never guess its way through.
 *
 * Composite entries — a channel list, a prompt record, a destination mapping,
 * a list of declined adapters —
 * are validated to the leaves their schema declares, so a credential nested
 * inside one fails closed exactly like an unknown key at the top.
 *
 * A remote reference is not a third answer to "does the reset delete this?". A
 * spreadsheet id is non-auth workflow configuration: the local value goes with
 * everything else, and the spreadsheet it names is provider-owned and survives
 * untouched. The preview states both, because a reader who saw only the first
 * would delete a spreadsheet and a reader who saw only the second would restore
 * an old destination.
