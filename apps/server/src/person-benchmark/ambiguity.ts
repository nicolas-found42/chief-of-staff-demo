/**
 * Deterministic classification of ambiguous semantic verdicts (issue #234).
 *
 * The classifier reads retained benchmark reports only: it repeats no
 * research, makes no model calls, and never alters the input reports. Every
 * ambiguous verdict is assigned exactly one named cause; anything that cannot
 * be decided from retained evidence lands in `undetermined-quote-mismatch`
 * explicitly, never guessed.
 *
 * Mechanism background (apps/server/src/person-benchmark/judge.ts and
 * evaluate.ts): the exact-claim guard forces a verdict to ambiguous when the
 * judge's quoted dossier text is not a verbatim substring of the named claim
 * (`(Downgraded: the quoted dossier text does not occur in the dossier.)`);
 * evaluate.ts downgrades recovered/partial verdicts to ambiguous when the
 * support/usefulness assessment did not complete
 * (`Original semantic verdict: ...; downgraded to ambiguous because ...`);
 * and a thrown reference-phase judge call leaves every fact of that person
 * ambiguous (`The judge did not return a usable verdict for this run.`).
