/**
 * No remaining caller performs a legacy dual-write (issue #199).
 *
 * The retired *routes* answering 404 is the behavioural half of this criterion,
 * and `meeting-debrief-review.test.ts` already holds it. A 404 says nothing
 * about a caller inside the process that never went through HTTP, and the
 * criterion is explicitly about callers: "a regression suite proves no
 * remaining caller performs legacy dual-write". "Nobody does this" cannot be
 * proven by exercising the callers you remembered to exercise, so this half
 * reads the tree.
 *
 * Its sibling `shell-composition.test.ts` warns that source text was the wrong
 * evidence for #125, and that warning is respected here: nothing below matches
 * prose. Every assertion is a parsed fact — an import edge, or a string literal
 * the program actually evaluates — so a comment mentioning a retired seam is
 * not a finding, and renaming a symbol inside a comment cannot make one go away.
