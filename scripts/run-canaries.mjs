/**
 * Run public canaries outside merge CI using the normal Source Adapter
 * diagnostic contract. This is the scheduled canary seam: it collects the
 * same small envelope as the Daily Intake (adapter.collect) and persists
 * results by adapter version, target, capability, route, and time, but a
 * failure here never fails the repository check gate.
 *
 * Intended to be invoked by `.github/workflows/canary.yml` (scheduled) and
 * locally via `node ./scripts/run-canaries.mjs`. Network access is required
 * for the live canaries; any failure is logged but the process exits 0 so
 * that a public-route change is visible without blocking other work.
