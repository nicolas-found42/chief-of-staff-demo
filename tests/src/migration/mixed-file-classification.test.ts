/**
 * The classification tables are a maintenance obligation with teeth (ADR-0046):
 * `config.json` and `relay.json` each hold authentication material next to
 * product state, so the migration parses them key by key against an explicit
 * table and fails the whole preview closed on a key that table does not name.
 *
 * That obligation had no test. `CONFIG_KEYS` mirrors `ConfigSchema` by hand, and
 * when #137 added `providerPolicy` to the schema the table was not updated —
 * every migration test still passed, because each one populated a hand-written
 * fixture that had also not been updated. The drift surfaced only when a browser
 * journey happened to run the preview over a Workspace a real Module had
 * written. A fixture cannot catch a key nobody remembered to add to it.
 *
 * So neither file's fixture is written here. Both are generated from the
 * declaration the table mirrors — `ConfigSchema` by zod introspection,
 * `RelayWorkspace` from its own interface declaration — populated to every leaf,
 * and put through the real preview. A key added to a declaration is populated by
 * construction, so a table that does not name it fails this test with the
 * dotted path, on the commit that adds it.
 *
 * The check is deliberately one-directional. Every key the declaration can
 * produce must be classified; a table key with no declaration behind it is not a
 * failure, because a pre-cutover `config.json` still holds keys the schema has
 * since dropped — `content-scout.notion` (#133), `guestProfile` (#136) — and
 * classifying those is exactly how the reset deletes them.
