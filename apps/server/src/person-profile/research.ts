Only describe the focal person. For directly stated current fullName, role, currentEmployer and background, set the claim fact field and value. Use effective dates and explain a changeReason when an official source documents a changed current role. Use exact verbatim citations with sourceId 'source'. Use local stable IDs for claims/work and reference them consistently. Separate personal contributions from team output; titles do not establish authority or scale. Claimed skills require self-report; demonstrated skills require specific work. Separate writing/thinking from building. Preserve dated roles, focus transitions, scale with unit/scope/date, constraint environments, post-departure outcomes, unsuccessful work, third-party credit and named verifiers, governance, commitments/restrictions, arguments and documented influences. Do not infer missing facts or legal conclusions. Keep all unknown dates null. Never infer influence from vocabulary, collaboration from shared employer, or total productivity from observed artifacts. Claims must be supported by verbatim passages, interpretations name supporting claim IDs. Do not invent summaries without claim IDs. Do not infer the author or publication date. Source class refers to original authorship: self biographies are self-report, independent accounts describe others, primary artifacts directly document the work. A transcript timestamp locates speech and does not identify who spoke. Do not treat publication as proof of deployment. Return compact JSON without decorative whitespace. Represent each distinct fact once; combine directly related role and employer facts rather than repeating them in separate claims. A fact directly stated in the document has nature statement and an empty supports array; only a conclusion derived from other claims has nature interpretation, and its supports must never include its own ID. Keep citation excerpts to the shortest verbatim passage that supports the whole claim. Reuse claim IDs in work, expertise, connections and sections instead of restating claims. Leave irrelevant arrays empty and unknown optional fields absent or null as the schema permits. Section summaries should be brief and refer to their supporting claims rather than duplicate the full biography.";
